This is gclip_select, a small program that allows you to re-select from the text
lines that were selected at one time or another as the X Primary Selection. This
is useful when, in X Windows, if you have selected something using the left
mouse button (as in the convention of the X Windows System) and you later
select something else but want to get back to the earlier selection.

Thus this program allows you to quickly switch between frequently copied texts
for pasting. When you select some text you will notice gclip_select window adds
the newly selected text to the list. And you can choose any earlier selection in
the list window to make it the X11 primary selection again; you can then past it
using the middle mouse button.

This program is written in Vala and requires gtk+2.0, glib 2.8 (or above) and
libgee 1.0 (or above), but you can build it following the usual GNU convention,
that is,

./configure --prefix=<install dir> 
make 
make install

to run it from the command line type
